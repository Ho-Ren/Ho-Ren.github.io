						<h3>User Research:</h3>
						<hr>
						<p>Hello!</p>
						<p> I'm a developer studying computer science in my 3rd year at the University of California at Irvine. Last summer, I interned at CE-CERT as a R&D intern for transportation systems research. Besides building applications, I love learning about UI/UX techniques and HCI.</p>
						<p>When I'm not developing software, I enjoy gaming, traveling, eating, and having a good conversation over coffee. Feel free to check out my work below or my <a href="https://ho-ren.github.io/resume/Ho-Ren.pdf" class="link-underline">resume</a>.</p>
