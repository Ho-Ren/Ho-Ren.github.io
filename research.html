						<h3>User Research:</h3>
						<hr>
						<p>Hello!</p>
						<p> I'm a developer studying computer science in my 3rd year at the University of California at Irvine. Last summer, I interned at CE-CERT as a R&D intern for transportation systems research. Besides building applications, I love learning about UI/UX techniques and HCI.</p>
						<p>When I'm not developing software, I enjoy gaming, traveling, eating, and having a good conversation over coffee. Feel free to check out my work below or my <a href="https://ho-ren.github.io/resume/Ho-Ren.pdf" class="link-underline">resume</a>.</p>

							<img src="img/UserInterview.png" width="500">
							<hr>
							<p>User interviews are always important to get an unbiased opinion to questions the interviewer may have. The questions I asked were mainly suggestions on improvements of the overall website and their initial thoughts on the aesthetics. </p>

							<img src="img/CompetitorAnalysis.png" width="500">							
							<hr>
							<p> Competitor analysis is used to identify competitors and see what makes their product strong and what potential weaknesses are present. Determining strengths and weaknesses on other portfolio sites can be difficult because everybody has different tastes but there are websites that are just universally good. I reviewed fellow UCI student Chris Wong's personal website as it was also built from scratch which shows that Chris is does not need to rely on existing frameworks to make his website look amazing.  </p>

							<img src="img/FeatureValueMatrix.png" width="500">							
							<hr>
							<p> A feature value matrix is a chart that determines the value of a particular feature for in terms of business, technical, and user value. The features I proposed were several different ways to contact me in the form of email, LinkedIn, and even GitHub. Giving other people options is always a good thing to have and giving recruiters an option to see my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles allows them to find more information about me in a professional setting.  </p>

							<img src="img/FeaturePrioritization.png" width="500">							
							<hr>
                            <p> Feature prioritization is the phase in which I prioritized the many different features I had in mind from the feature value matrix. Contact information has the highest priority simply because the purpose of this website is to not only show what kind of person I am and the work I have done, but also to have the user contact me for potential career opportunities. The contact information was placed at the bottom of the page after all the content.  </p>

							<img src="img/UserStories.png" width="500">							
							<hr>
							<p> A user story is a great method to learn what a potential user's expectations are and how they might use a certain product. My user stories are about recruiters, colleagues, and hiring managers because they are the main audience of my website.  </p>

							<img src="img/CognitiveWalkthrough.png" width="500">

							<p> A cognitive walkthrough is a process in which a user go through a series of tasks to demonstrate usability of a product. For my website, I conducted three cognitive walkthroughs with fellow classmates and colleagues. Many of their answers to my questions were expected. </p>

							<p> <a href="https://usabilityhub.com/tests/42da55621341/results" >Click Test</a> </p>
							<p> A user test is used to see how different people use a certain product. I used a click test to  see if people could easily figure out how to get my contact information. I also used a question test to see if users had similar impressions on the website. It was quite challenging to get the question test results to be consistent because of the limited amount of people testing as well as the overall openness of the questions. </p>

							<h3> Summary of Findings </h3>
							<hr>
							<p> Conducting both user testing and user research, I was able to learn more about the process behind creating a project from scratch. I learned to focus on design and structure first before actually implementing anything so I can get good feedback on aesthetics and usability. The user interviews and cognitive walkthroughs were both useful as the users gave great suggestions on what to add on my website.  </p>

							<h3> Incorproation of Findings </h3>
							<hr>
							<p>Place in at least 2-3 paragraphs of how you incorporated findings and/or how you plan to incorporate findings.  Be sure to include any challenges faced and how you arrived at solutions.  The idea is to capture how the process has helped in your understanding of how your interface can be improved and you actually took steps or plant to take steps to improve it. </p>
